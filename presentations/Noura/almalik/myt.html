   Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and <br>typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text <br>ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br>scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only <br>five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br> emaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <br> 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <br>including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
